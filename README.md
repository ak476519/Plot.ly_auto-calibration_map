# Plot.ly_auto-calibration_map
The demo is an auto-calibration from GPS coordinates to map scale, developed on top of Plot.ly in JavaScript.

Since Plot.ly only accepts url or data uri strings, images used for this demo are converted to data uri stored in a .txt file under the same name as the image.

Example: Open BeloitMap.txt to load up the map stored as BeloitMap.png.
