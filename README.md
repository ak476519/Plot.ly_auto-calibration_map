# Plot.ly_auto-calibration_map
The demo is an auto-calibration from GPS coordinates to map scale, developed on top of Plot.ly in JavaScript.

A temporary test ground before integrating into [Open Energy Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED).

Since Plot.ly only accepts url or data uri strings as image source, images used for this demo are converted to data uri stored in a .txt file under the same name as the image.

Example: Open BeloitMap.txt to load up the map stored as BeloitMap.png.
